📊 DSA Visualizer

An interactive Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer that helps you understand how algorithms work through smooth, step-by-step animations.

Built with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and learning-first design.

📌 Live Demo: https://makx-visualizer.vercel.app/

✔ Fixed SPA routing issue on refresh using Vercel rewrites.

✨ Features

✅ Step-by-step algorithm visualization,
✅ Adjustable animation speed,
✅ Random array generation,
✅ Adjustable array size,
✅ Custom target input for searching algorithms,
✅ Beginner-friendly UI for learning DSA visually,
✅ Responsive layout (desktop-first)


🌟 Algorithms Implemented

☑️ Sorting Algorithms

Bubble Sort,
Selection Sort,
Insertion Sort,
Merge Sort,
Quick Sort

☑️ Searching Algorithms

Linear Search,
Binary Search


⚙️ How It Works

Choose an algorithm category (Sorting / Searching)
Generate or customize the array
Adjust animation speed if needed
Watch the algorithm execute step-by-step
Each visualization highlights:

Active elements
Comparisons
Swaps / placements
Search ranges (for binary search)
Pivot, Found, Visiting


💻 Tech Stack

React – UI & component logic
