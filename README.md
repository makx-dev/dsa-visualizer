📚 Algorithms Implemented

🔵 Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

🟢 Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

🎮 How It Works

1. Choose an algorithm category (Sorting / Searching)
2. Generate or customize the array
3. Adjust animation speed if needed
4. Watch the algorithm execute step-by-step

Each visualization highlights:

- Active elements
- Comparisons
- Swaps / placements
- Search ranges (for binary search)
